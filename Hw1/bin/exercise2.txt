1. List main differences between primitive data type int and class Integer?
	From what I can remember from CS46b, data type int strictly hold the values that is inputted
	it lacks the convenience compared to Integer class as it has useful methods included with it.
	Methods commonly used such as parseInt or toBinaryString would only be available using Integer class.
	
2. What are advantages of using each one?
	The advantage as mentioned above is that using int will be faster and more convenient if we 
	don't need to do anything complex like converting numbers into objects or different types.
	
3.  List all specific functionalities that are available when using one and not the other.
	int will only offer the functionality of storing data into its declared variable.
	Integers will offer the functionality and convenience of using many methods associated with the 
	class Integer itself. Because the list of methods available is long, I have cited reference of usuable
	methods associated with class Integer in Sources2.
